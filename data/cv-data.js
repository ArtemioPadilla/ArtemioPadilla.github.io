    "summary": {
      "brief": "I'm a Mexican engineer focused on building reliable ML infrastructure that improves large-scale decision quality.",
      "tagline": "From atomic force microscopy to MLOps: I've scaled from nanometers to terabytes.",
      "full": "With a background in nanoscience research (STM/AFM/Raman spectroscopy) and a peer-reviewed publication, I learned the discipline of working at 10⁻⁹ meters in ultra-high vacuum. Today, I apply the same rigor to ML infrastructure—ensuring models scale reliably to 10⁹ requests.",
      "connection": "The connection? Both demand obsessive care with signal-to-noise ratios, drift compensation, and reproducibility. Debugging a production model feels like aligning a scanning tunneling microscope—except the stakes are millions of financial decisions instead of a research publication.",
      "current": "At Círculo de Crédito, I've built ML infrastructure with scientific-instrument-grade reliability (99.99% uptime, sub-second latency), while coordinating cross-functional teams and external partners to translate advanced models into real business value. Because when models decide who gets credit, \"good enough\" isn't enough.",
      "strengths": [
        "Patience forged from months refining a single spectrum",
        "Urgency of keeping production alive at scale",
        "Experience delivering infra where reliability is non-negotiable",
        "Ability to align teams and stakeholders—internal and external—toward measurable impact"
      ],
      "closing": "I also co-founded SECiD at UNAM, fostering Mexico's data science community with the same precision I once applied to spectrometers. I thrive in roles where ML infrastructure requires both microscopic attention to detail and macroscopic business impact—achieved not just through code, but by orchestrating people, processes, and technology."
